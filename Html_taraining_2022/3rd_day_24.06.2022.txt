Sending Data from browser to server and for sending data we have to assign 
that Data to variable.So taht reah to the server while we submit and we can 
perform operation on that data.

Local caches of the browser.

Radio button. 
We can select multiple values here in radio button also but if we name 
variable name same then we can select only one  because the datatype of 
radio button is variable..we can select only one value .

CheckBox .
It is created using array or list data type so we can select more than one 
options while selecting checkbox .

When we select multiple options we have an attribute value in the checkbox so 
we can set the value for that and send to the sever for further operations.

Action attribute of form:--
-----------------------------

The data we filled in html page inside the page that has an atributte varible  name 
inside the tag will goto the server side when we place action where we have to 
send data to the server. 

All the data that has been collected from the html page  has a variable name 
inside will be send to the server that is mentioned in the form tag inside the 
action attribute.Server side programme will perform further programme on that data.

Client side decides where to send the data througth action attribute inside form.

Get and Post.
When we send the data to the server by default method use to send data is get
but it shows the data inside the url adn save in browser history that is not good
for security so have to change the method attribute form "GET" to "POST"

Entire Web Page is divided into two parts one is Head part one is body part.

Web Page :- Head + Body.

Body
 
Any data we want to display on the page/white screeen is known as body tag.
we can change background color of the page through propeties inside body.

Head
Any data that run behind the scene and not displayed on body is Head tag.
css and js code will be inside Head Tag
