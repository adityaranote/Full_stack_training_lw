css :- It is used to design the website 
we can put css code in diferent file (external code )
we access this by linking this file inside head tag

Internal code we can put some code inside Html file to put some specific 
design 

It is good to use classes while accessing code then id's because
we use id's also in javascript.So it may create confusion 
also use different id names for each tag.
