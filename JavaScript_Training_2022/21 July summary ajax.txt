1. Form :- It helps user to interact.
It helps  users creating the url . We can also send data 
direct from  url

2. When client connects to the server it uses http protocol and 
http protocoal has two things 1. header and 2. body

what ever we see is body part

3. By default when we send request it is get request
Data is visible in the querry string if we sending it with
get request 


4. We have to change the mehtod to Post while you cannot see
data in url but if You inspect in devloper tool you can 
see data inside  payload .. post does not gives you security you 
have to change your http protocol to https protocol


Limitation of form :-
Send data without the use of form because we don't want our 
page to reload

We are sending data of input tag by clicking the button 
with the help Js code

We donot want to use submit button and form because it reloads 
page so heres the role of ajax comes

Ajax :- 

We have to write BackEnd Code for this by using Express frame
work
