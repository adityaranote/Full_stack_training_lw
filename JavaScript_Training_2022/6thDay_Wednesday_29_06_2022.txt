Dom :- 



Web Page Created = Dom created

We as a developer write html document
and browser create dom 

Dom = Documnet object Model
dom is created by the browser

Every element or tag is different object in web page

To interact with dom objects there are multiple different ways one of the ways is 
api

Javascript prebuilt methods is used to access object  in dom 
and what ever the properties the object has we can use those properties to perform
any operation. 

form validation through javascript had special requirement
for form we use javascript code.
if normal empty fields required value only we use keyword(required).
